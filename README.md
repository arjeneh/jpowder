Jpowder is a collaborative project between the ISIS Facility of the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the E-Learning and Software Develepment Unit of the Kasem Bundit University.

One analytical area in which ISIS excels is that of powder diffraction. This is a technique that is used worldwide on a daily basis by chemists and physicists to study polycrystalline materials. It is, for example, a crucial technique in the pharmaceutical industry where it is used to characterise the physical forms of drug materials. Data generated by powder diffraction experiments consists typically of two columns, where each row is a single data point (x,y).

In addition Jpowder is designed to be used as a tool for testing software usability and human computer interaction, with the purpose of given the user the best experience of using the software and using Jpowder as a tool for testing new approaches to E-learning.

Jpowder uses the following software libraries: JFreeChart, iText and JXLayer.
