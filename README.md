Jpowder was developed as a collaborative project between the ISIS Facility of the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the E-Learning and Software Develepment Unit of the Kasem Bundit University.

Jpowder is a Java tool aimed to provide a lightweight Web-App for plotting powder diffraction data, hence its name J-powder.

In addition Jpowder was designed as a tool for testing software usability and human computer interaction.

Aspects of this tool are demonstrated in:

* Jpowder: a Java-based program for the display and examination of powder diffraction data, J. Appl. Cryst. 2010, https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889810041543
* Jpowder Version 2: For the Display and Examination of Powder Diffraction Data Using Stack Plot, Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 2013, https://doi.org/10.4236/jsea.2013.64021

Jpowder uses the following software libraries: JFreeChart, iText and JXLayer.
