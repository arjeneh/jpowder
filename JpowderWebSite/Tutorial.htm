                          <h2>Powder Diffraction and Bragg's Law  </h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                       Neutron diffraction is the scattering of neutrons to determin the atomic and/or magnetic structure of a material. A sample to be examined is placed in a beam of thermal or cold neutrons to obtain a diffraction pattern that provides information of the structure of the material. The technique is similar to X-ray diffraction but due to their different scattering properties, neutrons and X-rays provide complementary information, X-rays interact primarily with the electron cloud surrounding each atom but neutrons interact with nuclei.<br />

Crystal Structure Determination<br />
The determination of an unknown structure proceeds in three major steps:<br />
<ol>
<li>The shape and size of the unit cell are deduced from the angular positions of the diffraction lines.</li>
<li>The number of atoms per unit cell is then computed from the shape and size of the unit cell, the chemical composition of the specimen, and its measured density.</li>
<li>Finally, the position of the atoms within the unit cell are deduced from the relative intensities of the diffraction lines.The third step is generally the most difficult and there are many structures which are known only incompletely, in the sense that this final step has not yet been made.</li>
</ol>
<br />
Size and Shape of the Unit Cell<br />
This step is same as the indexing of power diffraction pattern. It involves:<br />
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            The accurate determination of peak positions.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Determination of the unit cell(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure#Unit_cell) parameters from the peak positions.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Bragg’s Law 
                          </li>
                           <li>
                             Interplanar d-spacing
                          </li>
                           <li>
                             Systematic Absences
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
Ideally this process is done with a crystal structure, but when this cannot be done, a powder form of the material is used as a sample. When powder is used, the neutrons are scattered a lot more and create a pattern of rings with the sensors.<br />
 <img src='http://jpowder.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pictures/bowl-stem.jpg' width="250" height="228"> <br />
The JPowder software shows these rings in a graph with the angle of the ring on the x axis and intensity of the ring on the y axis.<a> <br />
 <img src='http://jpowder.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pictures/Untitled1.png' width="450" height="228"> <br />
Each peak on the graph is a ring, because as the angle (2Ɵ) icreases the intensity peaks and drops with the rings.<a> <br />

<h2>Bragg's Law  </h2>
<img src='http://jpowder.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pictures/bragglaw.jpg' width="450" height="228"> <br />
Bragg’s law is: <img src='http://jpowder.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pictures/braggeq.jpg' width="75" height="25"> <br />
When neutrons are scattered from a crystal lattice, peaks of scattered intensity are observed which correspond to the following conditions:<br />
<ol>
<li>The angle of incidence = angle of scattering.</li>
<li>The pathlength difference is equal to an integer number of wavelengths.</li>
</ol>
The condition for maximum intensity contained in Bragg's law above allow us to calculate details about the crystal structure, or if the crystal structure is known, to determine the wavelength of the x-rays incident upon the crystal.<br />
