#How to compile the source code.

= How to compile the source code =
The source code contains the project files for Netbeans version 6.7, which is compatable with version 6.7.1, and therefore the quickest way to compile Jpowder is to first install one of these version of Netbeans from 

  http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/dev.php

On this web site select 6.7.1 from the ‘!NetBeans version’ combobox on the right hand side and then hit the 'continue' button situated below this combobox. You will then be forwarded to a web-page where you will be presented with a number of download options. You can pick any of the download options which includes 'Java SE'.

The next step is to download the source from by clicking the 'Source' tab or following the link http://code.google.com/p/jpowder/source/checkout.

And finally from Netbeans select File->Open Project... and from your downloaded SVN go to the directory code/JpowderViewer and select from this directory the Netbeans folders Applet, Core and Standalone.
