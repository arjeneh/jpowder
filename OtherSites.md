# Introduction #

This is just a place for placing links to sites that look good and which one of us may come back to at a later stage.

## Open Source Java project ##
http://code.google.com/p/esmska/ (note uses web start as a download option)

http://code.google.com/p/javauploader/ (for uploading pictures rather than diffraction patterns. Uses what appears to be the same base code for the File chooser, or perhaps it is the same?)

http://code.google.com/p/javanotebook/wiki/JavaApplet1 (demonstrates that an applet can be run from within a google wiki page, although a preliminary look at the page code indicate that this is not plain sailing)

http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/ (includes a page demonstrating how to create an html page running the jzebra Applet)
