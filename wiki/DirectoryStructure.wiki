The Jpowder Code directory is structured as follows:


|| *Top directory* || *Sub-directory* || *Description* ||
|| !JpowderViewer || || Root !JpowderViewer directory ||
|| ||  Applet || Code specific to !JpowderViewer-Applet || 
|| ||  Core || Any code common to !JpowderViewer-Applet and !JpowderViewer-Standalone || 
|| ||  Libraries || External libraries, e.g. JFreeChart || 
|| ||  Standalone || Code specific to !JpowderViewer-Standalone || 

Note as of this writing the Applet project is empty. Also, it may turn
out that !JpowderViewer-Applet sub-application will be merged in with
the !JpowderViewer-Standalone application.
