The ability to display and inspect powder diffraction data quickly and efficiently is a central part of the data analysis process. Whilst many computer programs are capable of displaying powder data, their focus is typically on advanced operations such as structure solution or Rietveld refinement. This article describes a lightweight software package, _Jpowder_, whose focus is fast and convenient visualization and comparison of powder data sets in a variety of formats from computers with network access. _Jpowder_ is written in Java and uses its associated Web Start technology to allow 'single-click deployment' from a web page, [http://www.jpowder.org]. _Jpowder_ is open source, free and available for use by anyone.

==1. Introduction==

There is no shortage of computer programs that are capable of displaying powder diffraction data, often as the logical outcome of an analysis step such as a Rietveld refinement. Such programs include, for example, _TOPAS_ (Coelho, 2003), _FOX_ (Favre-Nicolin & Černý, 2002), _!HighScore_ (2010), _Endeavour (Putz _et al_. 1999), _DASH_ (David _et al_., (2006) !FullProf_Suite_ (Rodriguez-Carvajal, 1993), _GSAS_ (Larson & Von Dreele, 1994), _EXPO2009_ (Altomare _et al_., 2006), _EVA_ (2010), _PowderX_ (Dong, 1999) and _Powder3D_ (2008). However, such software packages are designed mainly for analysis of diffreaction data (_e.g._ Rietveld refinement, structure solution, quantitative phase analysis, indexing _etc_.). Here, a simple, lightweight, easy-to-access program (_Jpowder_) for straightforward visualization and comparison of powder diffraction data sets is presented.

_Jpowder_ uses both the Jva Web Start and Java applet technologies. Java Web Start provides the power to launch fully featured Java applications with a single click and without the need to go through complicated operating system installation procedures. It increases performance by caching application resources and provides automatic update management by checking for application updates on each application launch. If new versions of any Java archive (JAR) files that constitute the application are available from the from which they were originally accessed, Java Web Start downloads them before running the application. Furthermore, the nature of the Java Web Start model can enable applications to be installed by the end-user in a 'locked down' environment, such as a student teaching laboratory in a university department.

Using the same codebase, a limited range of _Jpowder_ functionality has been exposed in the form of a Java applet - a self-contained Java component that is embedded within a standard HTML web page. This provides an even more convenient mechanism to present data in an interactive style on the web.

The Java programming language has been used by many scientists to develop applications that offer excellent performance and portability, and some notable Java-based programs in the field of crystallography and molecular display include _Jmol_ (2008), _MAUD_ (Lutterotti & Bertolotti, 2003), _JCrystal_ (2010) and _Kiosk_ (2010). The _Jmol_ applet has been widely adopted for the interactive display of molecules on the web. The applet version of _Jpowder_ aims to do the same for powder diffraction data.

==2. _Jpowder_ overview==

_Jpowder_ is optimized for visual inspection of powder data. Data files can be dragged into _Jpowder_ from the desktop or by using the _Jpowder_ Explorer window (Fig. 1) When the Explorer window is used, multiple files from multiple folders can be selected simultaneously. 
The data are visualized as plots in charts, also reffered to as plot windows. Plots may be manipulated using the mouse or a number of shortcut keys. In addition, variousetools are available to aid plot comparison, for example, by moving, rescaling and changing the appearance of plots. Charts can be exported in variouse ways, including using the 'PDF' for publication option. _Jpowder_ also includes tools for basic data analysis tasks, including, for example, selecting peaks to a peak list, which can subsequently be exported to an indexing program such as _DICVOL_ (Boultif & Louër, 2004), and a tool for switching _x_ axes between 2θ and _d_ spacing to aid comparison of data sets collected at different wavelengths. Charts can be saved to disk in '_Jpowder_-applet format' (a serialized object), which can susequently be loaded into the applet version of _Jpowder_. This feature can be used to publish powder data not only as static images but also as interactive applets that offer the same manipulation options as a _Jpowder_ chart; see, for example, [http://www.jpowder.org/JpowderApplet.html].

==3. Program Description==
===3.1. Supported file formats===
The following file formats are supported for this version of _Jpowder:_
 * XY format (.xy). Two-column ASCII format, where the data in the first column are assumed to be the diffraction angle in 2θ and those in the second column are X-ray or neutron counts.
 * XYE format (.xye). As for XY format, but with an additional column listing the estimated standard deviations for the counts. This format also supports the use of a single real number, specifying a wavelength, as the first line of the file.
 * CIF format.
