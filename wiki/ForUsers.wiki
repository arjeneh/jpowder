The ability to display and inspect powder diffraction data quickly and efficiently is a central part of the data analysis process. Whilst many computer programs are capable of displaying powder data, their focus is typically on advanced operations such as structure solution or Rietveld refinement. This article describes a lightweight software package, _Jpowder_, whose focus is fast and convenient visualization and comparison of powder data sets in a variety of formats from computers with network access. _Jpowder_ is written in Java and uses its associated Web Start technology to allow 'single-click deployment' from a web page, [http://www.jpowder.org]. _Jpowder_ is open source, free and available for use by anyone.

==1. Introduction==

There is no shortage of computer programs that are capable of displaying powder diffraction data, often as the logical outcome of an analysis step such as a Rietveld refinement. Such programs include, for example, _TOPAS_ (Coelho, 2003), _FOX_ (Favre-Nicolin & Černý, 2002), _!HighScore_ (2010), _Endeavour (Putz _et al_. 1999), _DASH_ (David _et al_., (2006) !FullProf_Suite_ (Rodriguez-Carvajal, 1993), _GSAS_ (Larson & Von Dreele, 1994), _EXPO2009_ (Altomare _et al_., 2006), _EVA_ (2010), _PowderX_ (Dong, 1999) and _Powder3D_ (2008). However, such software packages are designed mainly for analysis of diffreaction data (_e.g._ Rietveld refinement, structure solution, quantitative phase analysis, indexing _etc_.). Here, a simple, lightweight, easy-to-access program (_Jpowder_) for straightforward visualization and comparison of powder diffraction data sets is presented.

_Jpowder_ uses both the Jva Web Start and Java applet technologies. Java Web Start provides the power to launch fully featured Java applications with a single click and without the need to go through complicated operating system installation procedures. It increases performance by caching application resources and provides automatic update management by checking for application updates on each application launch. If new versions of any Java archive (JAR) files that constitute the application are available from the from which they were originally accessed, Java Web Start downloads them before running the application. Furthermore, the nature of the Java Web Start model can enable applications to be installed by the end-user in a 'locked down' environment, such as a student teaching laboratory in a university department.

Using the same codebase, a limited range of _Jpowder_ functionality has been exposed in the form of a Java applet - a self-contained Java component that is embedded within a standard HTML web page. This provides an even more convenient mechanism to present data in an interactive style on the web.

The Java programming language has been used by many scientists to develop applications that offer excellent performance and portability, and some notable Java-based programs in the field of crystallography and molecular display include _Jmol_ (2008), _MAUD_ (Lutterotti & Bertolotti, 2003), _JCrystal_ (2010) and _Kiosk_ (2010). The _Jmol_ applet has been
