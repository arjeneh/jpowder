The Jpowder site is no longer maintained, but the source code for this site and software is here available to reuse, studie etc.

Jpowder was developed as a collaborative project between the ISIS Facility of the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the E-Learning and Software Develepment Unit of the Kasem Bundit University.

Jpowder is a Java tool aimed to provide a lightweight Web-App for plotting powder diffraction data, hence its name J-powder.

In addition Jpowder was designed as a tool for testing software usability and human computer interaction.

Aspects of this tool are demonstrated in:

* Jpowder: a Java-based program for the display and examination of powder diffraction data, J. Appl. Cryst. 2010, https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889810041543
* Jpowder Version 2: For the Display and Examination of Powder Diffraction Data Using Stack Plot, Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 2013, https://doi.org/10.4236/jsea.2013.64021

Jpowder uses the following software libraries: JFreeChart, iText and JXLayer.

Code was previously hosted on Google Code and using SVN. For some reason the SVN history from Mar 16 2017 (SVN commit 1) to 24th May 2018 2007 (SVN commit 52) was not transferred over when the Google Code SVN repo was moved to Github. For these commit see: https://code.google.com/archive/p/jpowder/source.
