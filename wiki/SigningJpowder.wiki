#summary Signing a web start application (Jpowder).

= Reason =

Jpowder is deployed as a Java web start application. In order for this application to work as a 'normal' application, which e.g. can access files from local disk, it must be signed. 

= Requirements =

To sign jars for use in web start you need JDK installed, which includes Jarsigner.exe in the jdk bin directory. 

= Step by step =

  * Package the application into a jar (from Netbeans e.g. right-click Standalone and select clean and build which will create the jar file Standalone\dist\Jpowder.jar)
  * The default keystore file used for signing Jpowder is located at trunk\code\Signing_Jpowder\Jpowder.jks. The certificate name for this keystore is "Jpowder". If you are creating your own keystore, please use this name, or something equivalently obvious or neutral. The Jpowder.jks file is added to SVN for convenience. If jarsigner.exe, Jpowder.jks and Jpowder.jar is in the same directory then sign Jpowder.jar using the command (if not in same directory then add relevant paths):
